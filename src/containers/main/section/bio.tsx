          Iâ€™m Dimas, a Software Engineer who delivers enterprise systems
          end-to-end and a front-end creative at heart. By day I design robust
          architectures, implement features across the stack, and own
          deployment: provisioning servers, hardening access, and automating
          releases so shipping is smooth and repeatable.
        </p>

          Outside the enterprise lane, I specialize in stunning, high-polish
          websites and portfolio experiences with thoughtful layouts, clean
          typography, accessible design, and subtle motion that feels alive. I
          care about performance, maintainability, and details that delight.
