          Iâ€™m Dimas, a Frontend Developer who loves turning ideas into clean,
          functional, and visually stunning web experiences. Whether itâ€™s
          crafting pixel-perfect UI with React and Tailwind or optimizing
          performance to make things run buttery smooth, Iâ€™m all about pushing
          the web forward. Always experimenting, always learning, and always
          excited to build something that makes a difference.

          When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me diving into graphic design, going
          for a run, or exploring new places to soak in fresh inspiration.
          Whether itâ€™s creating, moving, or discovering, Iâ€™m always chasing new
          experiences that fuel my creativity.
